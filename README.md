# Flatten to New Layer

#### An Aseprite extension
*current release: [v1.0.0](https://sudo-whoami.itch.io/flatten-to-new-layer)*

## Latest Changes
- Initial Release!

##
This Aseprite extension allows you flatten the layers in a sprite to a new layer, preserving any existing layers.

You can also choose to flatten only visible layers to a new layer.

### Requirements

This extension has been tested on both Windows and Mac OS (specifically, Windows 11 and Mac OS Sonoma 14.3.1)

It is intended to run on Aseprite version 1.3 or later and requires API version 1.3-rc5 (as long as you have the latest version of Aseprite, you should be fine!)

### Features & Usage

To use this extension, go to the Layer menu in Aseprite and then select "Flatten to New Layer" or "Flatten Visible to New Layer". You can also access these commands from the right-click popup menu in your sprite's layer list.
